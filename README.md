We will implement the paper "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation". This paper is treated as the fundamental paper in the field of Medical Image Processing, and is usually the first paper everyone implements when learning about Deep Learning applications in the Medical Imaging.


Plan:

* Read the Paper
* Get the dataset
* Create a dataloader
* Implement the architecture 
* Replicate the results (keeping in mind the computational bottleneck)
* Try to do some improvements / something different than the paper.
* Provide reasonging for the suggested changes.
* See if they change / improve performance in any way.
* Can create a pull request in offical Unet git repo and suggest changes
